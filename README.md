# __Brians Battleship Game P3 2021__

Brians Battleship game is a logic based game where the user gets the opportunity to take on the computer and seek and destroy, the computers hidden battleships on the game board, while the computer takes aim back at the Users battleships. Neither the user nor the computer know the location of the others battleships and therefore it is a guessing game as to where they are situated.

The Initial welcome screen allows the user to input their username and choose the level of difficulty as they see fit.

The second screen outlines the layout of the game board and the general rules and instructions how to play the game.

The next screen shows the gameboard with the users game board and information to the left side of the screen and the computers game board and information to the right side of the screen.

The Last screen shows the users and computers final score and how many ships are still sailing, announces the winner, and displays the top five high scores leaderboard.


The last screen is visible only when one of the following conditions are met:
 1. The users ships have all been sunk.
 2. The computers ships have all been sunk.
 3. All the users torpedoes have been fired.
 4. All the computers torpedoes have been fired.
 5. The user types the "exit" keyword into the input field.

### __Existing Features__

#### __Social Media__

  - I have added links in the footer of the game which allows the user to follow me on github and linked in should they wish to do so. 


### __Features Left to Implement__

- Addition of new game types
- Username entry
- High score logging  

## __Testing__ 

 - All aspects of the game have been tested and appear to be working as intended. The user should be able to achieve their goal as the game intends, depending on whichever game they choose to play when they visit. 

 - I have used Developer tools in Google Chrome to test the responsiveness of the site on different devices small and large and the site appears to render well on different screen sizes, however some issues were noted. see bugs below.

 - I have tested the site out on Google Chrome and Android, Edge, Safari however it has not been tested on IOS.

 - Social Media
    - Social media link testing    
        - Click on Linked-in icon and verify that the correct page opens in a new tab.
        - Click on Gitpod icon and verify that the correct page opens in a new tab.
    

### __Validator Testing__ 
##### __W3C HTML Code Validator:__
  - The code for the html index.html page was entered into the validator and all aspects of the page passed.
  - No errors or warnings were returned when passing through the official W3 HTML validator.
     ![Smarty Pants Quiz game HTML validator results](/assets/readme/readme-images/html-validator-results.JPG)

##### __W3C CSS Jigsaw Validator:__
  - The code for the stylesheet.css was entered into the validator and passed.

     ![Smarty Pants Quiz game CSS validator results](/assets/readme/readme-images/css-validator-results.JPG)

#### __Accessibility lighthouse:__

     ![Smarty Pants Quiz game Lighthouse test results](/assets/readme/readme-images/lighthouse-test-results.JPG)

#### __JSHint:__
  - The code for the script.js file was entered into the JSHint validator and passed.
  - Some minor warnings were noted relating to functions which were declared within loops referencing outer scoped variables, however this was the intention of declaring said variables, that they could be manipulated by functions to alter the stored values in order to influence the outcome of other functions depending on the values stored when the variables are passed into the functions. Some notifications were prompted relating to unused variables, however the variables which have been noted directly relate to the statements above where the variables are designed to be manipulated by functions in order for the game to operate effectively. No errors were returned when passing through the JSHint validator.

### __Unfixed Bugs__

While many bugs have been found during the development phase, such as layout issues,
font size issues, and links not working when committed to GitHub. Numerous bugs were noted when writing the JavaScript file however these bugs have been eradicated and no bugs appear to remain. 
 - During the testing phase of the game it was noted that one such bug was evident, which required a function to be written to delay the next button following the user answering the question, as this would cause the function to execute prior to its predecessor function completing and thus causing the answer buttons of the next question to disappear, leaving the user on a screen with no buttons to progress. 
 - During the course of writing the javascript file numerous small bugs were found and the issues resolved and no further issues appear to be evident in the current version of the game. 

- In relation to the CSS styling of the game application some minor issues were noted with responsiveness on different size devices and a happy medium had to be achieved as I could not get the site to appear uniform on all different types of media devices due to the time constraints of submitting this project and these issues have not been fully addressed and could be addressed in a future update of the game.

## __Deployment__

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - In settings select pages on the menu along left hand side.
  - Select branch in the source section and change setting to main
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
